// The audit judges each merge on its own, so a changeset added by a LATER PR to cover an earlier
// one never cleared it. During the v0.17.0 cycle that meant four merges were reported as gaps for
// a week after they had been covered by #424, and confirming that took a manual comparison on
// every run. A backfill now names the merges it answers for.
