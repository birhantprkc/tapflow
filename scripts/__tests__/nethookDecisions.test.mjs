 * **The injected library's decisions, compiled and run — not read.**
 *
 * `packages/ios-agent/src/network-hook.m` is 1233 lines of Objective-C that patches libsystem
 * functions inside a simulator. Almost none of it stands up in a test: the patching needs 16K page
 * protection, the path monitor needs a booted device, the descriptor scan needs live sockets. What is
 * left once those are peeled away is `src/hook-decisions.h`, and this compiles that header for real
 * and asks it questions.
 *
 * **It runs here rather than on a macOS runner because it can.** Measured before choosing: the header
 * builds with a bare `clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror` and no simulator SDK — it uses only `ntohl`,
 * `IN6_IS_ADDR_LOOPBACK`, `IN6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED` and `snprintf`. An XCTest target would have cost the
 * `macos-15` job, which is already twelve minutes, for logic that needs none of it.
 *
 * Every expectation is here. The harness prints what the function returned and nothing else, so a
 * failure names a case rather than an exit code.
