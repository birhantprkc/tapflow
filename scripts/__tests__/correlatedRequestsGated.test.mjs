// Every browser request that declares a **required** `requestId` must be gated at the relay's door, because
// every reply it can produce declares the correlator required too — so an ungated request means the relay
// either ships a frame with an absent required field, or forwards one whose reply nobody can attribute.
// Both were live defects: `requestId: msg.requestId!` in `clipboard:error` and, one slice earlier, in
// `open-url:error`. The second was fixed and the first survived next door for a whole slice.
//
// The claim "one policy at the door" was prose in a comment until this file. It is checkable because the
// property is **presence of a gate** — unlike the echo obligation, where the property is provenance and no
// check can see it (see the note above `OpenUrlReplyBody`).
//
// The member set is **derived** from the protocol, so an eighth correlated request added later fails here
// rather than being noticed by whoever reads the comment.
//
// **Where the gate lives moved, and this file moved with it.** It used to be `isCorrelated(msg)` written
// into each `case`, or a dispatch to a handler whose parameter was narrowed to `{ requestId: string }`.
// Since #444 the door is a parse: `@tapflowio/protocol/validate` refuses a frame whose schema declares
// `requestId` before `route` ever runs. So the property to check is that each correlated request's
// **schema** demands the correlator — the same claim, one layer earlier, and now covering the empty
// string as well as the absent field without either being spelled out at a call site.
//
// Checking the schema rather than the case body is also why this survives the next refactor of the
// switch: the gate is no longer something a `case` can forget to write.

  //

  // not exist for a non-input request.
