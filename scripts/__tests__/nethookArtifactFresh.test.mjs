/**
 * `bin/libtapflow-nethook.dylib` is committed as a prebuilt, and every test that exercises the
 * network hook injects a *fake* dylib path — so nothing in the suite has ever read the real one.
 * Editing `network-hook.m` and shipping the previous binary was therefore invisible, and #653 was
 * written in exactly that state: the source said `rename`, the shipped binary still truncated in
 * place, and 862 tests were green.
 *
 * **A failure here is yours to fix, unlike the netfilter one next door.** That extension is
 * Developer-ID signed and notarized on a maintainer's Mac, so its guard failing is a handoff. This
 * needs only Xcode's command-line tools:
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @tapflowio/ios-agent build:nethook
