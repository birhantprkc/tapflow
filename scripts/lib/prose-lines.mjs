/**
 * The lines of a markdown body that are actually prose: no fenced block, no indented block, and
 * — with `skipFrontmatter` — nothing inside the leading `---` delimiters.
 *
 * Shared on purpose. Both markers below are switches that turn a gate OFF, so a body that merely
 * QUOTES one must not trip it; every doc in this repo prints both verbatim. `extractReason` had
 * this guard and `parseBackfills` was written without it, which is exactly the kind of drift a
 * second copy invites.
