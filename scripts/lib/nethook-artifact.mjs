/**
 * What ties the committed injected library to the sources it was built from.
 *
 * `bin/libtapflow-nethook.dylib` is a prebuilt committed to the repo, and until #653 it had no build
 * script either — the flags lived in whichever shell last produced it. So the failure this catches was
 * not merely possible, it was the normal case: **edit `network-hook.m`, forget the rebuild, and the
 * suite stays green while the shipped binary does the old thing.** Nothing else in the repo can see
 * that, because every test that exercises the network hook talks to a fake dylib path.
 *
 * **Unlike the network filter, a contributor can fix a failure here.** That extension is Developer-ID
 * signed and notarized on a maintainer's Mac — a red guard there is a handoff. This one needs only
 * Xcode's command-line tools, and `packages/ios-agent/build-nethook.sh` reproduces it: the flags were
 * recovered from the committed binary and confirmed by a rebuild whose every section matched byte for
 * byte. The failure messages below say so, because sending someone to a maintainer for a build they
 * can run themselves is its own kind of wrong answer.
 *
 * **Recording the source hash alone would not catch it**, for the reason the netfilter guard states
 * and which applies unchanged: whoever forgets the rebuild forgets the record too, both values stay
 * consistent with each other, and the check passes. The artifact's hash is recorded as well, and
 * `build-nethook.sh` writes both in the step that produces the binary.
 *
 * What it does **not** claim: that the committed binary was built from the committed sources. Nothing
 * here can say that. It says the two were recorded together and neither has moved since.
