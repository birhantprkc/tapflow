// The shared status card beside the device viewer (#748). It is the one persistent status region for
// the Android and iOS viewers, and the rule that the decoder-unsupported message lives there is what
// keeps both platforms from shipping their own unsupported-decoder UI. The wiring down from the
// viewers is covered by `decoderUnsupported: boolean` being a *required* prop on the interface:
// removing the prop from a viewer call site is a compile error.
//
// `performanceMode()` (called inside the card to render the Smooth/Standard label) returns
// `'unsupported'` in jsdom because `canvas.getContext('webgl2')` returns null — `MODE_LABEL` maps
// that to `null`, so no Smooth/Standard label appears in these tests. The card still renders its
// focus row, fps row, and the persistent `role="status"` region.
