/**
 * One agent per Mac, per platform — claimed at startup and refused rather than fought over.
 *
 * **This exists because the alternative was an ownership model, and the ownership model was the wrong
 * answer to the wrong question.** Two agents on one Mac both enumerate the same host-wide simulator
 * list and both write the same host-wide filter rule, so the second one starting used to put every
 * device the first had taken offline back online. Making that *correct* would mean tracking who owns
 * each device across processes, in a store with no owner and no transactions, read from a synchronous
 * path — three design rounds established that the system has nowhere to keep that fact.
 *
 * The relay had already answered the question: agent identity there is `IOPlatformUUID` + platform,
 * one per Mac, and a second registration **evicts the first agent's socket**. So the configuration is
 * not supported; it just failed late, at the filter, instead of early, with a sentence.
 *
 * **Parallelism is untouched.** One agent manages every simulator on its Mac, and many testers on
 * many devices is exactly what already works. What is refused is a second `tapflow agent start` for
 * the same platform on the same machine.

/**
 * Kept short on purpose: `sun_path` is **104 bytes** on Darwin and a longer path fails `EINVAL` at
 * `listen`, which was measured the first time this was tried from a nested temp directory.
 *
 * **`/tmp` rather than `tmpdir()`, because the resource is machine-wide and `tmpdir()` is not.**
 * `os.tmpdir()` answers a uid-scoped directory on macOS and honours `TMPDIR`, so a second account —
 * or a `sudo` run, whose `env_reset` drops `TMPDIR` — resolved a different path and both took the
 * slot. That is a false *allow* over a host-wide filter, which is the direction that costs something.
 *
 * `/tmp` is world-writable with the sticky bit, which trades that for a false *refuse*: one account
 * cannot unlink another's leftover socket, so a stale claim from a different user is reported as one
 * rather than taken over. That is rare, it is the safe direction, and it gets its own sentence
 * instead of being reported as "already running".
