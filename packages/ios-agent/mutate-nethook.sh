# Mutation testing for `src/hook-decisions.h` — the decidable half of the injected library.
#
# **A green run of `nethookDecisions.test.mjs` is not evidence on its own.** Several of its cases
# assert that something is *not* loopback, *not* blocking, *not* activated — and a test asserting
# absence passes when nothing happens, which is its definition
# (`contributing/test-and-guard-coverage.md` rule 2). The mutations below break the header in the ways
# those cases claim to catch; any that still passes is decoration.
#
#   ./mutate-nethook.sh
#
# **The checkout is never written to.** The header is copied elsewhere, broken there, and the test is
# pointed at the copy through `NETHOOK_HEADER_DIR`. That is deliberate rather than tidy: layer 1's
# equivalent mutated its sources in place, and three times in one day `build-nethook.sh`'s netfilter
# counterpart compiled, signed and notarized a source a mutation had broken. There is no window here.
