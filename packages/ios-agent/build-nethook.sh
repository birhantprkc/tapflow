# Build `bin/libtapflow-nethook.dylib` from `src/network-hook.m` + `src/inline-hook.c`.
#
# **This file exists because the recipe was nowhere.** The dylib is committed as a prebuilt binary,
# like `ios-netfilter`'s app — but unlike that one it had no build script, so the flags lived only in
# whichever shell last produced it. Changing `network-hook.m` meant guessing them.
#
# They were recovered from the committed binary rather than remembered: `otool -l` gives the platform
# (7 = iOS simulator), `minos 17.0` and the linked frameworks, and `size -m` confirmed the guess —
# every section of a rebuild matched the committed one byte for byte, `__text` included at 9040. That
# is what makes the flags below right rather than plausible.
#
# `-fobjc-arc`: the sources use no retain/release. `-O2`: matches the committed `__text` size; -Os and
# -O0 do not. The install name is the output path, which is what the committed binary carries — it is
# injected by absolute path through `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, so nothing reads it.
