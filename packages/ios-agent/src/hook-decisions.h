/*
 * The decidable half of `network-hook.m`, kept here **so it can be tested**.
 *
 * Everything else in that file reaches something a unit test cannot stand up: `dlopen`ing the
 * process's own libraries, patching 16K pages, walking live file descriptors, re-firing an
 * `nw_path_monitor` handler on the queue its owner chose. What is left once those are peeled away is
 * this — four questions answered from their arguments alone.
 *
 * **Plain C on purpose, and no Foundation.** These compile with a bare `clang` on any host, with no
 * iOS simulator SDK, which is what lets the tests run in the ordinary `test` job rather than on a
 * macOS runner. `scripts/__tests__/nethookDecisions.test.mjs` compiles this header into a harness and
 * runs it; `network-hook.m` includes the same header, so the tests judge the shipping code rather
 * than a copy of it.
 *
 * `static inline` rather than a `.c`: one translation unit includes it in production and one in the
 * harness, so there is nothing to link and `build-nethook.sh` does not change. It is still an input
 * to the dylib's hash — `scripts/lib/nethook-artifact.mjs` refuses a local `#include` that is not in
 * `SOURCE_FILES`, which is how this file got added there rather than by anyone remembering.

// MARK: - how far the descriptor scan goes

/**
 * The scan bound, and what it costs when it truncates.
 *
 * `tf_cut_open_connections` walks descriptors to shut down the app's external sockets. `RLIMIT_NOFILE`
 * can be enormous — `OPEN_MAX` — and walking millions of them on a toggle is worse than missing the
 * tail of a process holding more than this.
 *
 * **`capped` is why this returns two things.** A silent cap looks exactly like a process with nothing
 * left to cut, so the caller logs when it trims — and a boolean nothing sets is a log line nothing
 * fires. Passing it back is what lets a test hold the difference.
 *
 * `haveLimit` is the caller's `getrlimit(…) == 0 && rl.rlim_cur != RLIM_INFINITY`: an unreadable limit
 * and an infinite one are the same answer here, which is to fall back rather than to walk forever.
