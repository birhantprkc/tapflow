// ── Agent capabilities ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Advertised in `agent:register` so a viewer can tell what the agent on the other
// end actually implements. An agent that predates a capability simply does not list
// it, so `undefined`/absent means "not supported" — no version parsing, and nothing
// has to be inferred from a timeout (guessing that way once produced a double paste
// on a merely-slow agent, and a lost keystroke on an old one).
// The dashboard cannot import from here (it has no agent-core dependency), so this stays a
// plain string list on the wire rather than a helper nobody on the reading side can call.
// `full-reset`: the agent honours `device:boot`'s `resetMode: 'full-erase'` by wiping the device
// before booting it. Both platforms do as of #447 — iOS with `simctl erase`, Android with
// `-wipe-data` — and an agent that does not says so by not listing it rather than by being named in
// a platform check on the viewer.
//
// `network-control`: the agent implements `network:set` (#607). **This one claims less than the
// other two do.** They are settled facts about the agent's own code; whether the network mechanism
// actually takes is per device and per app — an injection that did not land, an emulator image too
// old for the command — and this string is sent once at `agent:register`, before any device is
// booted. So it means "this agent has the code", and `network:state.available` carries the rest.
// Reading it as a promise that the toggle will work is the mistake this comment exists to prevent.

 *
 *  Two deadline windows are inside the answer: confirm the sentinel applied, then watch for the
 *  copy. The restore window is not — the reply goes out before it starts.
 *
 *  Five device calls, not four. Each windowed loop checks its deadline AFTER the call returns,
 *  so a window can overrun by one call; counting the loops' overruns plus the fixed calls
 *  (read the original, ready the guest for the chord, write the sentinel) gives five.
 *  Undercounting these is what previously left the browser giving up first on this very path.
 *
 *  NOT a hard upper bound, and it cannot be one. Every device call carries its own multi-second
 *  timeout (5s for a simctl pasteboard call, an emulator gRPC deadline, an adb keyevent), so a
 *  genuinely wedged device can take far longer than this. `CLIPBOARD_DEVICE_CALL_MS` is an
 *  observed-under-load figure, not a ceiling. What this budget buys is that the *normal* slow
 *  path — a real device that simply had nothing selected — answers before the browser stops
 *  listening. A hung device loses the specific message; that is the correct trade, since at that

 *  learned about it by waiting out its own deadline — 30s for `mcp-server`, 120s for `flow-runner`, and a
 *  spinner that never resolves for a viewer (#526).
 *
 *  Shared rather than declared per platform because the *user-visible* answer must not differ by platform.
